# House Sales Time Series Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting house sales prices using a time series dataset enriched with additional features derived from the data. The goal was to build a machine learning model that effectively predicts sales prices and evaluates its performance based on RMSE.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about house sales, including features such as:
- `price`: The sale price of the house (target variable).
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
- `post_code`: Postal code of the property.
- `property_type`: Type of property (e.g., detached, semi-detached).
- `date`: The date the house was sold.

---

## Preprocessing Steps
### 1. **Column Renaming**
- Renamed columns to make them more readable and consistent.

### 2. **Handling Missing Values**
- Missing values in the `bedrooms` column were filled with the median number of bedrooms.

### 3. **Outlier Identification**
- Added a new column to identify outliers in the `price` column using statistical techniques (e.g., IQR).

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
- Extracted time-based features from the `date` column:
  - `day`: Day of the sale.
  - `month`: Month of the sale.
  - `year`: Year of the sale.

### 5. **Data Encoding**
- **Label Encoding**:
  - Encoded the `bedrooms` column into numerical categories.
- **One-Hot Encoding**:
  - Applied to `post_code` and `property_type` columns.

### 6. **Data Transformation**
- Applied scaling to normalize the data.
- Performed logarithmic transformation on the `price` column to reduce skewness.

## Modeling
### Model Used
- **XGBoost Regressor**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm optimized for tabular data.

### Model Parameters
- `n_estimators`: 1000
- `learning_rate`: 0.05
- `max_depth`: 6

### Training and Testing
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained the model on the training data and evaluated it on the test set.

---

## Evaluation
### Performance Metric
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 145,813
  - The RMSE indicates the average error in predicted house prices.
  - The mean house price in the dataset: 609,736

---

## Results and Insights
1. The model performed reasonably well, with an RMSE of approximately 24% of the mean price.
2. The addition of time-based features improved the modelâ€™s ability to capture seasonal trends.
3. Outlier detection and removal contributed to better model stability and performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of XGBoost and advanced preprocessing techniques to predict house sales prices. Future improvements could include:
- Experimenting with additional models, such as LightGBM or neural networks.
- Incorporating external data sources, such as economic indicators, to improve predictions.
- Optimizing hyperparameters using advanced techniques like Bayesian Optimization.
